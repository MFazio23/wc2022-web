                    Normally, this would some huge blob of legalese that nobody would read.<br/><br/>

                    The only personal info I get from the site your email address and name (when you log in with a third-party service.)<br/>
                    Your email address allows me to connect accounts across Google, Facebook, and Twitter into a single account.<br/>
                    Your name allows me to display it for the site/app and any groups.<br/><br/>
                    I <i>am</i> using Google Analytics to get metrics on the site.  If this makes you uncomfortable, feel free to block it.<br/>
                    I'm just looking for numbers and to see if anyone cares about this thing.<br/><br/>
                    Past that, I don't get any personal info nor do I want it.<br/>
